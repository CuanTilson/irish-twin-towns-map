          What is Town Twinning?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg max-w-prose space-y-6">
          Town twinning is a cultural and social partnership between towns or
          cities in different countries. These relationships are established to
          foster friendship, understanding, and cooperation across borders.
          Through town twinning, communities share experiences, promote cultural
          exchange, encourage tourism, and develop economic and educational
          ties. The connections often lead to joint events, student exchanges,
          business collaborations, and mutual visits that enrich local life and
          build lasting international bonds.

          This site explores the unique network of Irish towns and their twin
          towns around the world, showcasing how these partnerships strengthen
          global relationships and celebrate shared heritage.

          A Brief History of Town Twinning
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-4xl mb-8">
          Town twinning, also known as sister city partnerships, began in the
          aftermath of World War II as a grassroots movement to promote peace,
          understanding, and cooperation across borders. The idea was simple yet
          powerful: connect towns and cities from different countries to foster
          cultural exchange and mutual respect. These partnerships became
          symbols of reconciliation and hope during a time of rebuilding.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-4xl mb-8">
          In Europe, the movement gained momentum with the formation of
          institutions like the **Council of European Municipalities and Regions
          (CEMR)**, which helped formalise thousands of links between
          townsâ€”particularly between France and Germany in the 1950s. Over time,
          town twinning expanded beyond Europe, creating global networks of
          friendship and cooperation. Today, there are more than **40,000
          twinning arrangements** worldwide.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-4xl">
          In **Ireland**, the tradition took hold in the latter half of the 20th
          century, often driven by local councils, diaspora links, and shared
          heritage. Many Irish towns are now twinned with counterparts in
          **France, Italy, Germany, the United States**, and beyond. These
          partnerships have led to joint festivals, student exchanges, economic
          collaborations, and deep personal connections that endure across
          generations.
